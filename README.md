# Rogan-Helper (老眼OCRルーペ)

This is a small personal Web app created to help read small printed text
(e.g. labels, manuals, product information) that becomes difficult to see with age.

The app is intentionally simple and lightweight.
It is designed for personal use, not as a commercial service.

  you must obtain **your own API key** from the OCR service provider.

The API key may be changed, restricted, or disabled at any time
without prior notice.

## Philosophy

This project is not about technical perfection.
It is about choosing what is *enough*.

- No continuous OCR
- No heavy processing
- No unnecessary features

Just read, and leave a small trace if needed.
